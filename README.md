**How do people walk?** --- `Analysis on people’s weekly step count data`




<img width="875" alt="截屏2022-10-26 下午9 57 03" src="https://media.github.sydney.edu.au/user/10750/files/4142496f-210f-4cb7-a3f6-f6c99d1102e2">




Advanced electronic device are simple and inexpensive wearable motion sensors that are easily used by researchers and practitioners to assess and motivate physical activity behaviors. Hence pedometer-determined physical activity indices are needed to guide their accumulated data. Our report is introducing some specific factors that would affect step counts weekly and evaluating the probability of being healthy based on in sample data applied to logistic regression.




# Group members and contracts

1. When you will reserve a time to meet outside of class each week, for the 
weeks that are needed.
* `Every Sunday.`
2. How you will meet – include here details people need to know.
* `We meet face to face in fisher library.`
3. How you will communicate e.g. mail and agreed response time.
* `Wechat platform.`

# Ethical Considerations. 
#### [Wiki page](https://github.sydney.edu.au/rsun5771/2022-DATA3406-CC05-Group1/wiki/Ethical-consideration)

-------------------

## Purpose

* #### ***The purposes involved ethical issues from in sample data and out of sample data.*** 

`In sample data`
  * We explored different participants' datasets to discover some possible factors that will be affecting weekly step counts based on potential aspect of health.

`Out of sample data`
  * For fairness, we were trying to reach our results as many people as possible to be more comprehensive in out of sample data. Hence, we were trying to use a classification algorithm to predict probability of being healthy not only stakeholders but also majorities.

## Data

### Key files

### Data origin

Our data is about steps data for each day recorded by participants' activity trackers. Some trackers recorded the steps data seperated by time in hours or date. Predictors are asked for step data. Most of data are gotten from Apple Health processed with a python script to convert the xml to csv.
 
### Data definitions

Summary of files, tables, and fields. You can use markdown `tables` here to improve the formating of the information.

## Ethicals considerations

### Why it is matters

### Stakeholder analysis

### Raw Data

o `Nature of raw data include Categorical and numerical`

Categorical: the date for start, date for finish 

numerical: the stpes count 

o `Describe the process of data collection.`
Collection includes apple watch ,electrical trackers.
