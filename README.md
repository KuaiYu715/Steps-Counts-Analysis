# Proejct description

**How do people walk?** --- `Analysis on people’s weekly step count data`

Advanced electronic device are simple and inexpensive wearable motion sensors that are easily used by researchers and practitioners to assess and motivate physical activity behaviors. Hence pedometer-determined physical activity indices are needed to guide their accumulated data. Our report is introducing some specific factors that would affect step counts weekly and evaluating the probability of being healthy based on in sample data applied to logistic regression.




# Group members and contracts

1. When you will reserve a time to meet outside of class each week, for the 
weeks that are needed.
* `Every Sunday.`
2. How you will meet – include here details people need to know.
* `We meet face to face in fisher library.`
3. How you will communicate e.g. mail and agreed response time.
* `Wechat platform.`

* `Group manager:` Lixin Mu 490570753

## Sub-questions
How many weeks has less steps relativity?

What is the seasonality of the week to week data?

How does week-to-week data illustrates the probability of participate getting unhealthy? As doctors generally consider fewer than 10000 steps per day to be sedentary.

## Background

## Data

### Key files

### Data origin

Our data is about steps data for each day recorded by participants' activity trackers. Some trackers recorded the steps data seperated by time in hours or date. Predictors are asked for step data. Most of data are gotten from Apple Health processed with a python script to convert the xml to csv.
 
### Data definitions

Summary of files, tables, and fields. You can use markdown `tables` here to improve the formating of the information.

## Ethicals considerations
